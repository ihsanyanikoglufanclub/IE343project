# Album Optimization
French Lebanese trumpeter Ibrahim Maalouf went in studio to record his new album.  The company wants you to determine which songs will be included in Ibrahim Maalouf’s next album.
French Lebanese trumpeter Ibrahim Maalouf went in studio to record his new album. Throughout the recording sessions, he and his band recorded 50 songs in total. 
These songs have different durations as the nature of the music. Mi’ster Productions Label executives imply that the new album should be at most 30 minutes, and each second that the total duration of album missing decreases the value of the album by 0.02 points. 
After the recording session is done, the label has conducted market research to determine the values of the songs. You can find the corresponding data in “term_project_value_data.csv” file. 

In the first part of the project, the company wants you to determine which songs will be included in Ibrahim Maalouf’s next album. 
Note that there is a cost about being too far from the expected duration. Design an algorithm that solves the problem and compare it with the exact solution that can be found in the “exact_method.ipynb” file.

In the second part of the project, the label has conducted a second market research to determine the track list of the album.
For example, if there is value of 3 from song 1 to song 3, that means focus groups thinks that if you listen song 3 after song 1, you are likely to enjoy 3 out of 10. 
Here, as a consultant, you have been asked to solve this track list problem with a relevant heuristic. The only rule that company has been asked is, they want to have the most valuable song that has been selected as the first song and second most valuable song that has been selected as the last song.

You can find the relevant dataset on “term_project_sequential_data.csv” file.
Please be informed that you need to give a complete report about the coding approach, the explanation of your algorithms with steps, any decision that you have made as well as the numerical results and CPU usage, with the benchmark in the first step of the algorithm.
You will be given a Git repository that includes the datasets that you will use throughout the project, a .java file that includes the exact solution method code and the objects that you need to use within the scope of the project.

If you want to use another artist to work, you can deal with it by using "datagen.ipynb" file and entering Client ID and Client Secret for Spotify API. You can refer it to this link for getting a Client ID and Secret for the Spotify API.

https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/

After you create your developer account, you can go to Dashboard and find your Client ID and Secret. Note that you are not obliged to do it, you can do it if you want.

You can also use the datagen if you want to fetch any data from Spotify API. Feel free to contact with me for possible projects.
